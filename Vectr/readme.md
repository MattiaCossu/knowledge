# VECTR

**VECTR** is a tool that facilitates tracking of your red and blue team testing activities to measure detection and prevention capabilities across dierent attack scenarios.
VECTR provides the ability to create assessment groups, which consist of a collection of Campaigns and supporting Test Cases to simulate adversary threats. Campaigns can be broad and span activity across the kill chain, from initial compromise to privilege escalation and lateral movement and so on, or can be a narrow in scope to focus on specic detection layers, tools, and infrastructure. VECTR is designed to promote full transparency between oense and defense, encourage training between team members, and improve detection & prevention success rate across the environment.
