# LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution):

1. LLMNR is a protocol used in local area networks (LANs) to resolve host names into IP addresses.
2. It works by allowing devices in the same local network to send broadcast queries to obtain the IP address associated with a host name.
3. It is often used when the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is unavailable or not configured in a local network.
