# MDNS (Multicast DNS):

1. MDNS is a protocol used to resolve host names and services within local networks without the need for a centralized DNS server.
2. It is particularly common in networks based on Apple devices and Unix/Linux systems.
3. MDNS uses multicast to allow devices in the network to announce their host names and the services they offer.
