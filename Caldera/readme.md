# Caldera

CALDERA™ is a cyber security framework designed to easily run autonomous breach-and-simulation exercises. It can also be used to run manual red-team engagements or automated incident response. CALDERA is built on the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework and is an active research project at MITRE.

The framework consists of two components:

1. **The core system.** This is the framework code, including an asynchronous command-and-control (C2) server with a REST API and a web interface.

2. **Plugins.** These are separate repositories that hang off of the core framework, providing additional functionality. Examples include agents, GUI interfaces, collections of TTPs and more.
